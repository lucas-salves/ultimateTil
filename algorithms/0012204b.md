# Algorithmic Complexity

Big O is a notation used to classify algorithmic complexity. A big O of a algorithm tells you his performance and efficiency according to the volume of information input.
So, if you have more than one algorithm to solve a problem, you can use Big O notations to determine which algorithm is more performative.

### Constant Big O O(1):

The function below prints a number received by parameter. Note that, Regardless of which input is (1 or 1000000000) the cost for execution will always be the same.
```
	void myNumber(inputNumber){
		System.out.println("Seu número é" + inputNumber);
	}
```

In the Big O, the input of data is represented by the N letter.
Essentially, O(1) it's a mathematical equation that describes the effort given an N input.
In this case, the Big O is a constant, because regardless of the input, the effort to execute is the same.
So, we can say that given an input N, the cost will always be 1.

A constant big O is represented as in the image below. Where the horizontal axis represents the input data and the vertical axis represents the cost/time to execute the input data.
As we can see, it will be always the same cost.

### Linear Big O O(n)

In this example, before print the last result, the algorithm prints from 1 to the specified number.
So, if the input is 1, it will run very fast. But if it's 1000000000, it will take a few seconds because it will print all numbers between 1 and 1000000000 before print the result.

```
	void myNumber(inputNumber){
		for(var i = 0; i < inputNumber; i++){
			System.out.println("Seu número é" + i);
		}
	}
```

So, the cost of this algorithm is no longer constant because it varies according to the input. The larger the input, the longer the execution time.
So, in this case the Big O is O(N), because, given a N input, the cost will be linearly proportional to the input.

The image above illustrate  how a O(N) is graphically represented.

## Quadratic Big O O(n²)

Now, before print the specified number, let's print a square with the same number of columns and rows that the input number.
```
	function myNumber(inputNumber){
		for(var i = 0; i <= inputNumber; i++){
			row = "";
			for(var j = 0; j <= inputNumber; j++){
				row = row +" " + inputNumber;
			}
			System.out.println(linha);
		}
		System.out.println("Seu número é: " + inputNumber);
	}
```
For this, we need to add a loop inside the other.
So, a single loop has a cost O(n). As we've added a loop inside another loop, for each execution of the first loop, we have the full execution of the another loop. So, the Big O of this function is: O(n²).
Now, the cost increases quadratically as the input. So, if the input is 4, 16 operations are required to execute the algorithm.
So, given a N input, the cost will be N².
