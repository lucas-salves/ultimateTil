# Return with no expression

You can have a return with no expression if your method returns void. 
The example below simply pops a frame from the call stack returning the control to the line following the function call:
```
void someFunct(int arg)
{
    if (arg == 0)
    {
        //Leave because this is a bad value
        return;
    }
    //Otherwise, do something
}
```
