# What is "String args[] in main method java"

The *args[]* parameter is used for command-line arguments.
>

    String[] args is a collection of Strings, separated by a space, which can be typed into the program on the terminal. More times than not, the beginner isn't going to use this variable, but it's always there just in case.

Example:
```
java MyProgram one two
```
