# Encoding query parameters

#### Why do encode query parameters?

> URLs can only have certain characters from the standard 128 character ASCII set. Reserved characters that do not belong to this set must be encoded.

This means that we need to encode these characters when passing them into a URL. Special characters such as &, space, ! when entered in a URL need to be escaped, otherwise, it may cause unpredictable situations.

#### Java URL query parameter encoding

```
String q = "random word Â£500 bank $";
String url = "https://example.com?q=" + URLEncoder.encode(q, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```
