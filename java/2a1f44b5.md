# Java EE vs Java SE

## Java SE
Provides the core functiionallity of the Java programming language.

## Java EE
Is build in top of the Java SE and providas an API and runtime environtment for developing network applications.

## Overview Java Enterprise Applications (EE)
The Java EE platform help developers create large-scale, multi-tiered, scalable, reliable and secure network applications. A shorthand name for such applications is "enterprise applications", so called because these applications are designed to solve the problems encountered by large enterprises, but that not means that it works only for large corporations.

### Tiered Applications
The functionalities of the applications are separated into isolated areas, called tiers. 
Multi-tiered structure:
Tipically, multi-tiered applications have a client tier, middle tier and a data tier(often called the enterprise information systems tier).
* Client tier: client program that makes requests to the middle tier
* Middle tier: handle client requests and process application data, storing it in a datastore on the data tier.

Java EE application development cnocentrates on the middle tier to make enterprise application management easier, more robust, and more secure.

* The Client Tier consists of application clients that access a Java EE server and that are usually located on a different machine from the server. The clients make requests to the server. The server processes the requests and returns a response back to the client. Many different types of applications can be Java EE clients, and they are not always, or even often Java applications. Clients can be a web browser, a standalone application, or other servers, and they run on a different machine from the Java EE server.

* The Web Tier consists of components that handle the interaction between clients and the business tier. its primary tasks are the following:
	* Dinamically generate content in various formats for the client
	* Collect input from users of the client interface and return appropriate results from the components in the business tier
	* Control the flow of screens or pages on the client
	* Maintain the state of data for a users session
	* Perform some basic logic and hold some data temporarily in JavaBeans components

Java EE technologies used in Web tier:

| Technology | Purpose|
| :---:   | :-: |
|Servlets|Java classes that dynamically process requests and construct responses usually for HTML pages|
|JavaServer Faces technology|a user-interface component framework for web applications that allows you to include UI components (such as fields and buttons) on a page, convert and validate UI component data, save UI component data do server-side data stores and maintain component state.|
|JavaServer Facelets technology|A type of JavaServer Faces applications that use XHTML pages rather than JSP pages|
|Expression Language|A set of statndard tags used in JSP and Facelets pages to refer to Java EE components|
|JavaServer Pages (JSP)|text-based documents that are compiled into servlets and define how dynamic content can be added to static pages, such as HTML pages|
|JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library|a tag library that encapsulates core functionality common to JSP pages|
|JavaBeans components|Objects that act as temporary data stores for the pages of an application|

## The Business tier
Components that provide business logic for an application. Business logic is code the code that provides functionality to a particular business domain, like the financial industry, or an e-commerce site, in a properly designed enterprise application, the core functionality exists in the business tier components.

## Java EE Technologies Use in the Business Tier
The following java EE technologies are used in the business tier in Java EE applications

|Technology|Description|
|:---:|:-:|
|Enterprise JavaBeans (enterprise bean) components|Managed components that encapsulate the core functionality of an application|
|JAX-RS RESTful web services|An API for creating web services that respond to HTTP methods (for example GET or POST methods).JAX-RS web services are developed according to the principles of REST, or representational state transfer.|
|JAX-WS Web service endpoints|An API for creating and consuming SOAP web services.|
|Java Persistenci API entities|An API for accessing data in underlying data stores and mapping that data to Java programming language objects.|
|Java EE managed beans|Managed components that may provide the business logic of an application but do not require the transactional or security features of enterprise beans|

## The Enterprise Information Systems Tier
|Technology|Description|
|:---:|:-:|
|Java Database Conneectivity API (JDBC)|A low-level API for accessing and retrieving data form underlying data stores. A common use of JDBC is to make SQL queries on a particular database|
|Java Persistency API|An API for accessing data in underlying data stores and mapping that data to java programming language objects. Hides the complexity of JDBC from the user|
|Java EE Connector Architecture|An API for connecting to another enterprise resources, like resource planning or customer management system software.|
|Java Transaction API (JTA)|An API for defining and managing transactions, including distributed transactions or transactions that cross multiple underlying data sources.|
