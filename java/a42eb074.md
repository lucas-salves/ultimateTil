# For loops

Is used for iterating through lists, tuples, dictionaries, set, or a string.
This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages.It does not require a index variable.It works like an iterator method of a object-oriented programming language.

The example below prints each fruit in a fruit list:
```
fruits = ["apple","banana","cherry"]
for x in fruits:
	print(x)
```

## Looping throug a string
Strings are iterable objects because contains a sequence of characters:
```
for x in "banana":
	print(x)
```
## The break statement
Escapes froms the loop before it has looped through all the items.
The example below exit the loop when x is "banana":

```
fruits = ["apple","banana","cherry"]
for x in fruits:
	print(x)
	if x == "banana":
		break
```

## Continue statement
Stops the current iteration of the loop, and continues with the next.
The example below do not prints banana:

```
fruits = ["apple","banana","cherry"]
for x in fruits:
	if x == "banana":
		continue
	print(x)
```

## The range() function
Loops through a block of code a specified number of times:

```
for x in range(6)
	print(x)
```

## Else in for loop
Executes a block of code when the loop is finished.
Remember that the else block will not be executed if the loop is stopped by a break statement.
The example below prints all numbers from 0 to 5 and print a message when the loop has ended:
```
for x in range(6):
	print(x)
else:
	print("Finally finished!")
```

## The pass statement
for loops cannot be empty, but if for some reason you need this, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.
```
for x in [0,1,2]:
	pass
```
