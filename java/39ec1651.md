# Is Java Pass by value or Pass by reference?


## Pass by value vs Pass by Reference

- 1. Pass by value: The called function will work in a copy of the value of the argument. That is, all changes done in the method to this variable will reflect only inside the method.

- 2. Pass by reference: The called function will work in a reference of the original variable passed as parameter. That means that all changes of the argument will reflect on the original variable that was passed in the function call.

## Java is Pass by value or Pass by reference?

Java is Pass by value. However, the way that he manages storing variables can cause confusion.

- 1. Local variables like primitives and object references are created on Stack memory.
- 2. Objects are created on Heap memory.

So when we are dealing with the second case, when we call the method, a copy of the object is made on the Stack with different references, but it points to the same underlying object in Heap. So any change that you make using one reference is going to impact the common object.
