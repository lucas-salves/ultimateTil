# When to use long vs Long

*long* is a primitive

*Long* is a object, so:
* it can be *null*
* it can be passed to a method that wants an Object, Number, Long or long
* it can be used as a parameter type: *List<Long>*
* it can be serialized/deserialized via the java serialization mechanism.

> Always use the simplest thing that works, so if you need any of the features of *Long*, use *Long* otherwise use *long*. The overhead of a *Long* is surprisingly small, but it is there.
