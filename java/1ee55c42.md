# How to store api keys safely in environment variables


To help keep your API keys secure, follow these best practices:

* Do not embed API keys directly in the source code, because it can be accidentally exposed to the public if you forget to remove the keys before share your project.
The best way to store api keys is in environment variables or files outside your applications source tree.

## Creating path environment
First, we're gonna create a shell script file that will be responsible to store all keys in it. Every QA engineer will have this shell file on their local device.
```
create setenv.sh
```
Now, we're able to put the sensitive information:
```
export APP_KEY=4sdf5sd6df

export APP_SECRET=987ad5489s5

export ACCESS_TYPE=AccessType.Hard
```

The next step is load the environment variables:
```
source ./setenv.sh
```
The command above will read the file and execute the script.

## Calling the environment variables in the project code:
Now, we can access the environment variables directly from the code:
```
String apiKey = System.getenv("API_KEY");

String appSecret = System.getenv("APP_SECRET");

String accessType = System.getenv("ACCESS_TYPE");
```

The advantages of this approach are:
* There is no way to store variables in the git repository by accident
* You can use administration tools

The disavantages:
* Use a shell script
