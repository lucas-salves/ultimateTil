# Collections: frequency

Counts the number of times that a element is repeated in a list.

Syntax:
```
frequency(Collection c, Object o)

// c: Collection in which to determine the frequency of o.
// o: Object whose frequency is to be determined.
```

If the Collection is null, it throws a Null Pointer Exception

The example below, searches for repeated elements inside a Object List:

```

List<Object> list = new ArrayList<>();

var repeatedItems = list.stream()
			.filter(item -> Collections.frequency(list, item.getName()>1))
			.collect(Collectors.toList());

var repeatedItemsCount = repeatedItems.size()

```
