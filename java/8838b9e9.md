# Are class variables shared between threads?

Yes. Any method or variable, both static and non-static can be accessed by more than one Thread.
 An alternative to this is to use ThreadLocal<T> instead of it to declare variables that cannot be shared between threads. See the example below.
non-final parameters and local variables are also not shared between threads.

```
public class Foo
{
    // SimpleDateFormat is not thread-safe, so give one to each thread
    private static final ThreadLocal<SimpleDateFormat> formatter = new ThreadLocal<SimpleDateFormat>(){
        @Override
        protected SimpleDateFormat initialValue()
        {
            return new SimpleDateFormat("yyyyMMdd HHmm");
        }
    };

    public String formatIt(Date date)
    {
        return formatter.get().format(date);
    }
}
```
