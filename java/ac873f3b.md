# Comparable and Comparator

## Comparable

Comparable is an interface that defines a strategy to compare objects with other objects.

### Usage example
Let's line-up Players by their rankings.

First of all, let's create the Player class:

```
public class Player {
    private int ranking;
    private String name;
    private int age;
    
    // constructor, getters, setters  
}
```

Now, let's define our Player object as Comparable by implementing the Comparable interface. It looks like this:
```
public class Player implements Comparable<Player> {

    // same as before

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Player otherPlayer) {
        return Integer.compare(getRanking(), otherPlayer.getRanking());
    }

}
```
The Integer.compareTo() method returns an integer that indicates wheter the object being compared is less than, equal to, or greater than the object being passed as an argument.
Example: 
> 
Integer.compare(x,y);
//if x is less than y, returns -1
//if x is equals to y, returns 0
// otherwise, returns 1

The main method may look like the following:

```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    List<Player> footballTeam = new ArrayList<>();
    Player player1 = new Player(59, "John", 20);
    Player player2 = new Player(67, "Roger", 22);
    Player player3 = new Player(45, "Steven", 24);
    footballTeam.add(player1);
    footballTeam.add(player2);
    footballTeam.add(player3);

    System.out.println("Before Sorting : " + footballTeam);
    Collections.sort(footballTeam);
    System.out.println("After Sorting : " + footballTeam);
}
```

## Comparator

The Comparator interface defines a compare() method similar to Comparable.compareTo() method.

### Usage example

First of all, let's create a Comparator class to use the ranking of the Player to sort.

```
public class PlayerRankingComparator implements Comparator<Player> {

    @Override
    public int compare(Player firstPlayer, Player secondPlayer) {
       return Integer.compare(firstPlayer.getRanking(), secondPlayer.getRanking());
    }

}
```

### Conclusion
* That is, in the Comparable interface, the class of the objects that you want to sort must implement comparable interface. While using Comparator, this is not necessary.
* Comparable provides single sorting sequences while Comparator provides multiple sorting.
* Comparable can sort data according to the narural sorting order, while Comparator sorts by customized sorting order.
* Comparator doesn't affect the original class
