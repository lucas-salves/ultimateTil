# Conturrent Map

Hashmap is not a thread-safe implementation, while Hashtable does provide thread-safety by synchronizing operations.

ConcurrentMap is an extension of the map interface that provides a structure to solve the trhead-safety problem.
The following implementations are overriden:
* getOrDefault
* forEach
* replaceAll
* computeIfAbsent
* computIfPresent
* compute
* merge

The following apis are overriden to support atomicity:
* putIfAbsent
* remove
* replace(key,oldValue,newValue)
* replace(key,value)

ConcurrentMap guarantees memory consistency on key/value operations in a multi-threading environment
Most APIs of ConcurrentMap does not allow null key or value
