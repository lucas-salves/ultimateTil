# Error: "an enclosing instance that contains X.Y is required"

Class definition:
```
public class X
{
    public class Y
    {//some member functions and variables exist here}

    public class Z
    {//some member functions and variables exist here}

    //some member functions and variables exist here
}
```
Instances:
```
public X.Y oY = new X.Y();

```

### Resolution

You have to create an Y object, as the following:

```
X x=new X();
X.Y y=x.new Y();
```

Or, you can just declare static inner classes:

```
public static class Y
```
