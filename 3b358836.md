# Concurrency: Atomic Integer

Usage of atomic integer:
```
public class NumberCounter{
	private int count;
	AtomicInteger atomicCount = new AtomicInteger(0);

	public synchronized int getCount(){
		return count++;
	}

	public int getCountAtomically(){
		return atomicCount.incrementAndGet();
	}
}
```
The getCount() is not Thread-safe because of the ++ increment operator, that is not thread-safe.
This is dangerous, because, if multiple threads access getCount(), that can generate unexpected inconsistencies. incrementAndGet() guarantees that the scheduler will transfer the execution to the next thread only in the end of the execution by another thread, avoiding data inconsistency.
