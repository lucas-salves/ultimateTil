# If...else

## Elif
it's like a else...if shorthand
```
a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
	print("b is greater than a")
elif a==b:
	print("a and b are equal")
```
### elif...else example
```
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")
```

## Ternary operator
If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement:

```
if a > b: print("a is greater than b")
```

```
a = 2
b = 330
print("a") if a > b else print("B")
```

You can also have multiple else statements on the same line:
```
a = 330
b = 330
print("a") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")
```


## Logical operators
and, or
```
 a = 200
b = 33
c = 500
if a > b and c > a:
  print("Both conditions are True")
```
```
a = 200
b = 33
c = 500
if a > b or a > c:
  print("At least one of the conditions is True")
```

## Nested if
If statements inside if statements:

```
x = 41

if x > 10:
	print("above ten,")
	if x > 20:
		print("and also above 20!")
	else:
		print("but not above 20")
```

## Pass statement
if statements cannot be empty. If you for some reason have an if statement with no content, use pass tatement to avoid getting an error:
```
a = 33
b = 200

if b > a:
	pass
```
