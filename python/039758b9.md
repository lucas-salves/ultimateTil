# Python Operators

The operators are used to perform operations on variables and values:
The example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

```
print(10+5)
```

## Opetator groups

* Arithmetic operators
* Assignment operators
* Comparison operators
* Logical operators
* Identity operators
* Membership operators
* Bitwise operators

## Python Arthmetic Operators

Are used to perform common mathematical operations:

| Operator | Name | Example |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
|+|Addition|x+y|
|-|Subtraction|x-y|
|*|Multiplication|x*y|
|/|Division|x/y|
|%|Modulus|x % y|
|**|Exponentiation| x**y|
|//|Floor division| x// y|

## Python Assignment Operators
Are used to assing values to variables:

| Operator | Examplee | Same as |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
|=|x=5|x=5|
|+=| x+=3|x=x+3|
|-=|x -=3|x=x-3|
|*=|x*=3|x=x*3|
|/=|x/=3|x = x=3|
|%=|x%=3|x=x%3|
|//=|x//=3|x=x//3|
|**=|x**=3|x=x**3|
|&=| x&=3| x=x&3|
||=|x|=3|x=x|3|
|^⁼|x^=3|x=x^3|
|>>=|x>>=3|x=x>>3|
|<<=|x<<=3|x=x<<3|

## Python Comparison Operators

Are used to compare two values:
| Operator | Examplee | Same as |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
|==|Equal|x==y|
|!=|Not equal|x!=y|
|>|Greater than| x>y|
|<|Less than| x<y|
|>=|Greater than or equal to|x>=y|
|<=|Less than or equal to|z<=y|

## Python Logical Operators

Are used to combine conditional statements:
| Operator | Description | Example |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
|and|Returns true if both statements are true| x<5 and x<10|
|or|Returns true if one of the statements is true|x<5 or x<4|
|not|Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true|not(x<5 and x<10)|

## Python Identity Operators
Are used to compare the object and memory location:
| Operator | Description | Example |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
|is|Returns True if both variables are the same object|x is y|
|is not|Returns True if both variables are not the same object|x is not y|

## Python membership operators

Are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object
| Operator | Description | Example |
| :---: | :---: | :---:
|in|Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object|x in y|
|not in|REturns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object|x not in y|

## Python Bitwise Operators
Are used to compare (binary)numbers:
| Operator | Description | Example |
| :---: | :---: | :---: 
|&|AND|Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1|
|||OR|Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1|
|^|XOR|Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1|
|~|NOT|Inverts all the bits|
|<<|Zero fill left shift|Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall of|
|>>|Signed right shift|Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in form the leftm and left the rightmost bits fall of|
