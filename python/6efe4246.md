# Numbers

There are three diffent number types in python:
* int
* float
* complex

Numeric variables are created when you assign a value to them.
x = 1 # int
x = 2.8 # float
x = 1j # complex

Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.
```
x = 35e3
y = 12E4
z = -87.7e100

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z)) 
```

Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:
```
	x = 3+5j
y = 5j
z = -5j

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z)) 

#### Type conversion
Use int(), float() and complex() methods:

```
x = 1
y = 2.8
z = 1j

```
#convert from int to float
a = float(x)

#convert from float to int:
b = int(y)

# convert from int to complex
c = complex(x)

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c)) 
```
#### Note: You cannot convert complex numbers into another numbrtype.

### Random number
Python does not have a random() function to make a random number. Instead has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:
```
import random

print(random.randrange(1,10))
```
