# Tuples update

Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called. So you cannot change its values, but there is a workaround. Is possible to convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and then convert the list back into a tuple:
```
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(x)
y[1] = "kiwi"
x = tuple(y)

print (x)

```

## Add items
Since tuples are immutable, thei do not have a append() method.
The workaroun is: covnert the tuple to a list, add the items and convert it back into a tuple:

```
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(thistuple)
y.append("orange")
thistuple = tuple(y)
```

2. Add the tuple to a new tuple:
```
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = ("orange",)
thistuple += y

print(thistuple)
```

## Remove items

You can use the same workaround as we used for changin and adding tuple items.

Or you can delete the tuple completely:
```
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
del thistuple
print(thistuple)// this will throw an error because the tuple no longer exists
```
