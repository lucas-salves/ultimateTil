# Python scope

The variables are only available inside their scope.

## Local scope
A variable that is created inside a function, can only be used inside that function.
```
def myfunc():
	x = 300
	print(x)

myfunc()
```

## Function inside function
A variable is available for any function inside the function that is created:
In the example below, the local variable can be accessed from a function within the function:
```
def myfunc():
	x = 300
	def myinnerfunc():
		print(x)
		myinnerfunc()
myfunc()
```

## Global Scope
A variable that is created in the main body of the python code is called global variable
Global variables are available in any scope, global and local.	
As the following example shows, a global variable can be used by anyone:
```
x = 300

def myfunc():
	print(x)
myfunc()

print(x)
```

## Naming variables
If you have a global and a loca lvariables with the same name, python deal with them as two separate variables, one global and one local.
In the following example the function will print the local x, and then the code will print the global x:
```
x = 300

def myfunc():
	x = 200
	print(x)

myfunc()
print(x)

## Global keyword
Using the global keyword you can create a global variable, but inside a local sope.
The global keyword transforms the variable scope to global.

```
def myfunc():
	global x
	x = 300

myfunc()

print(x)
```

You can also use the global keyword if you want to make a change to a global variable inside a function

```
x = 300
def myfunc():
	global x
	x = 200

myfunc()

print(x)
```
