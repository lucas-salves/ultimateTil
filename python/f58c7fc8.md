# Join two lists

Using the + operator:
```
list1 = ["a","b","c"]
list2 = [1,2,3]

list3 = list1 + list2
print(list3)
```
Another way is by appending all the items from list2 into lis1, one by one:
```
list1 = ['a','b,'c']
list2 = [1,2,3]

for x in list2:
	list1.append(x)

print(list1)
```

Or, you can use the extend() method to add elements from one list to another list:
```
list1 = ['a','b','c']
list2 = [1,2,3]

list1.extend(list2)
print(list1)
