# Join Sets

## union() method
```
set1 = {"a","b","c"}
set2 = {1,2,3}

set 3 = set1.union(set2)
print(set3)
```

## update() method
Inserts the items of set2 into set1:

```
set1 = {"a", "b" , "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}

set1.update(set2)
print(set1)
```

## Note: both union() and update() will exclude any duplicate items

## intersection_update() method 
Will keep only the items duplicated, that is, that are present in both sets:

## intersection() method
Will return a new set, that only contains the items that are present in both sets.`

## Keep All, but NOT the duplicates
## symmetric_difference_update()
will keep only the elements that are not present in both sets	

## symetric_difference() method
WIll return a new set that contains only the elements that are NOT present in both sets.
