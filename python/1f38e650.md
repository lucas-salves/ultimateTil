# Variable names

## Rules for variable names:
* A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore
* A variable name cannot start with a number
* A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _)
* Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
