# Python Dictionaries

Are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
Dictionaries are ordered, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
## Note: In python 3.7 dictionaries are ordered. In python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.

```
thisdict = {
	"brand":"Ford",
	"model":"Mustang",
	"year":1964
}
print(thisdict)
```

## Get a item
```
thisdict = { 
        "brand":"Ford",
        "model":"Mustang",
        "year":1964
}
print(thisdict["brand"])

```
