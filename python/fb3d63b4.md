# Slicing Strings

Return a range of character using the slice syntax.
Scpecify the start and end index respectvely, to return a part of the string:
```
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:5])
```

## Note: the first character has index 0.

## Slice from the start
Omitting the start index, the range will start at the first character:
```
b = 'Hello world!'
print(b[:5])
```

## Slice to the end
By leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end:
```
b = 'hello world'
print(b[2:])
```

## Negative indexing
Negative indexes starts the slice from the end of the string:
Get the characters:
From: "o" in "World!" (position -5)
To, but not included "d" in "World!" (position -2):
```
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[-5:-2])
```
