# Python modules
Module is the same as a code library. A file that contains a set of functions that you want to include in your application.

## Create a module
Just save the code you want in a file with the extension .py:
For example, let's create a file called mymodule.py
```
def greeting(name):
	print("hello, "+name)
```

Now, we can use the module methods by using the import statement:
import mymodule
```
mymodule.greeting("Lusca")

```

The module can contain functions, as already described, but also variables of all types: (arrays,dictionaries,objects etc):
```
person1 = {
	"name": "Lucas",
	"age" : 36,
	"country" : "Norway"
}
//Import the module named mymodule and access the person1 dictionary:
import mymodule
a = mymodule.person1["age"]
print(a)
```
## Alias
You can create an alias when you import a module by using the as keyword:

```
import mymodule as mx

a = mx.person1["age"]
print(a)
```

## Built-in modules
There are several built-in modules in Python, which you can import whenever you like.
In the following example we are importing and using the platform module:
```
import platform

x = platform.system()
print(x)
```
## Using the dir() function
Is a built-in function that lists all the function or variable names in a module:
This function can be used on all modules, also the ones you create yourself.
```
import platform

x = dir(platform)
print(x)
```
## Import from module

You can choose to import only parts from a module, by using the from keyword:
```
def greeting(name):
	print("hello, "+name)

person1 = {
	"name":"lucas",
	"age":23,
	"country":"Norway"

}
```
Note that we are importing only the person1 dictionary from the module above:
```
from mymodule import person1

print(person1["age])
```
