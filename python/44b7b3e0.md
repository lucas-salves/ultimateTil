# Global variables
Variables that are created outside a function are global variables. They can be used outside and inside the functions:

```
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
	print("Python is " + x)


myfunc()
```
If you create a local variable with the same name of a global variable, this variable can only be used inside the function and the global variable with the same name will remain as it was.

## Global keyword
You can use *global* the keyword to make a global variable inside a function:
```
def myfunc():
	global x
	x = "fantastic"

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)
```
You can also use the *global* keyword to change a global variable inside a function:
```
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
	global x
	x = "fantastic"

myfunc()
print("Python is "+x)
```
