# Format

is not possible to combine strings and numbers like this:
```
age = 36
txt = "My name is Lucas, I am" + age
print(txt)
```

To make this possible, we can use format() method.
format() method takes de arguments, format them and places them in the string where the placeholders {} are:
```
age = 36
txt = "My name is Luca, and I am {}"
print(txt.format(age))
```

The format() method can take unlimited number of arguments, and are placed into the respective placeholders:
```
quantity = 3
itemnumber = 567
price = 49.95
myorder = "I want {} pieces of item {} for {} dollars."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemnumber, price))
```

Is possible to use index numbers {0} to select in which placeholder put the variables:
```
quantity = 3
itemnumber = 567
price = 49.95
myorder = "I want to pay {2} dollars for {0} pieces of item {1}"
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemnumber, price))
```
