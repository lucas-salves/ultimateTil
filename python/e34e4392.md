# Output variables

Python provides the *print* statement, that allows output variables.
To concat variables and  text, use the *+* character:
```
y = "Python is"
x = "awesome"
print(y + x)
```
Attention: For numbers, the *+* character works as a mathematical operator.

It's not possible to concatenate a string and a number. Python will throw an error:

```
x = 5
y = "lucas"
print(x + y)
```
Outputs:
```
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str' 
```
