# Python Iterators
An iterator is an object that contains a number o values that can be iterated upon.

## Iterator vs Iterable
Lists, tuples, dictionaries sets and Strings are iterable objects. That is, you can get an iterator from all of them.
These objects have a iter() method which is used to get an iterator.
The example below return an iterator from a tuple, and print each value:
```
mytuple = ("apple","banana","cherry")
myit = iter(mytuple)

print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
```

We can too use a for loop to iterate through an iterable object:
```
mytuple("apple","banana","cherry")

for x in mytuple:
	print(x)
```
Iterate the characters of a string:
```
mystr = "banana"

for x in mystr:
	print(x)
```

The for loop actually creates an iterator object and executes the next() method for each loop

## Create an iterator

You have to implement the methods __iter__() and __next__() to your object 
With the __iter__() method you can do operations but must always return the iterator object itself.
With the __next__() you can do operations too, and must return the next item of the sequence

The example below creates an iterator that returns numbers, starting with 1, and each sequence will increase by one (returning 1,2,3,4,5 etc.)
```
class MyNumbers:
	def __iter__(self):
		self.a = 1
		return self

	def __next__(self):
		x = self.a
		self.a += 1
		return x

myclass = MyNumbers()
myiter = iter(myclass)

print(next(iter))
print(next(iter))
print(next(iter))
print(next(iter))
print(next(iter))
```
