# List

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types used to store collections of data. The 3 other are: Tuple, Set and Dictionary.

List example:
```
thislsit = ["apple","banana","cherry"]
print(thislist)
```

List Items are ordered, changeable and allow duplicate values.
The first index of a list is [0].

## Ordered
Items have a defined order and that order will not change.
New items are added to the end of the list.

## Note: There are some list methods that will change the order, but in general the order of the items will no change

## Changeable
List allows us add and remove items in a list after it has been created.

## Allow Duplicates
Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:
```
thislist = ["apple","banana","cherry","apple","cherry"]
print(thislist)
```

## List Length
Returns how many items a list has:
```
thislist = ["apple","banana","cherry"]
print(len(thislist))
```

## List items
List items can be of any data type:
```
list 1 = ["apple,"banana"]
list 2 = [1,5]
list 3 = [True, False]
```

A list can contain different data types:
```
list1 = ["abc", 34, True,40,"male"]
```

## type()
From pythons's perspective, lists are defined as objects with the data type: 'list'.
```
<class 'list'>
```

## The list() constructor
It is possible to create a new list using the list() constructor
```
thislist = list(("apple","banana","cherry"))
print(thislist)
```

## Python Collections(Arrays)

* List is a ordered and changeable collection that allows duplicate members
* Tuple is a ordered and unchangeable collection that allows ducplicate members
* Set is a unordered and unchangeable and unindexed collection that doesn't allow duplicate members
* Dictionary is a ordered and changeable collections that doesn'nt allow duplicate members
