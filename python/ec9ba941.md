# Tuples

Are used to store multiple items with different types in a variable.
Is one of the built-in data types used to store collections of data (List, Set, Dictionary and Tuple).
Tuples are indexed(starts at 0), ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values

## Create a tuple
```
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple)
```

## Len function
Returns a count of items inside the the tuple
```
thistuple = ("apple","banana","cherry")
print(len(thistuple))
```

## Create a tuple with only one item
You have to add a comma after the item
```
thistuple = ("apple",)
print(type(thistuple))
```

## Create a tuple with different data-type items
A tuple with strings, integers and boolean values:
```
tuple1 = ("abc", 34, True, 40, "male")
```

## Tuple() constructor
It is also possible to use the tuple() constructor to create a tuple:
```
thistuple = tuple(("apple","banana","cherry"))
print(thistuple)
```
