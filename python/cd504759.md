# Classes / Objects

Use the keyword class to create a class.
In the following example, we are creating a class called MyClass and printing the X object
```
class MyClass:
	x = 5
```

```
p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)
```

## Constructors: The __init__() function
The __init__() function is always executed when the class is being initiated, like a constructor of other object oriented programming languages:

```
class Person:
	def __init__(self, name, age)
		self.name = name
		self.age = age

def myfunc(self):
	print("Hello, my name is "+self.name)

p1 = Person("John",36)	

print (p1.name)
print(p1.age)
```

## Note that the self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class

You can modify properties on objects like this:
```
p1.age = 40
```

## Delete object properties:
Delete properties on objects by using the del keyword:
```
del p1.age
```

## Delete objects
```
del p1
```

## Pass statement
A Class cannot be empty, but you for some reason have a class definition with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error:
```
class Person:
	pass
```
