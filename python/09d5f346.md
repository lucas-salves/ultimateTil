# Copy lists

Is not possible copy lists by just typing: *list2 = list1*, because list2 will be a reference to list1, and changes made in list1 will be reflected in list2.
A way to make a copy is use built-in List method *copy()*:

```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "mango"]
mylist = thislist.copy()
print(mylist)
```

Another way is use the built-in method list():
```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "mango"]
mylist = list(thislist)
print(mylist)
```
