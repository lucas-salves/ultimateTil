# Lambda

Is a small anonymous function that can take anu number of arguments but only one expression.

The example below add 10 to argument a and return the resul:
```
x = lambda a : a + 10
print(x(5))
```

## Why use lambda functions?
One of the main usages of a lambda is, to use inside another function:
```
def myfunc(n):
	return lambda a : a * n
```

Use lambda functions when an anonymous function is required for a short period of time.
