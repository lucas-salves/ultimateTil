# Transit Gateway

It is a transit center that connect VPCs and on-premises networks to each other.

## Attachments: you can attach the following:
* One or more VPCs
* One network device Connect SD-WAN/third-party
* One gateway of AWS Direct Connect
* One pairing connection of  with other transit gateway
* One VPN connection to a transit gateway

## Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU): is the size in bytes of the biggest package that can be broadcasted through connection. The larger the MTU of a connection, more data can be transfered in a single package.

## Transit gateway route table: A transit gateway has a default route table and can have additional route tables optionally. A routing table includes static and dynamic routes that determine the next leap based on the destiny package IP address. The destiny of that routes can be any transit gateway attachment.

## Associations: each attachment is associated to a route table. Each route table can be associated to zero or N attachmentos

## Route propagation
