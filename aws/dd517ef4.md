# EFS

With EFS you can create and share a file system through an EC2 instance.

Unlike EBS, EFS can be mounted by multiple EC2 istances, that means that many virtual machines may store files within an EFS.
EFS size is elastic. That means it grow or shrink according to demand, without disturbing your application or having to provision new infrastructure.

## Benefits
* Adaptive througput
* Totally elastic
* Can be mounted from different EC2 instances, but it can also across the AWS region boundary via the use of VPC peering
## When to use EFS?

Whenever you need a shared file storage option for multiple EC2 instances with automatic high-performance scaling. It is ideal for storing code and media files.
