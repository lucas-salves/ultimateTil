# Why use Multithreading in a web application

Multi-threading is mainly used in asynchronous calls.
Consider an API call which can take a long time. During a call the application would wait to finish the call. But the call can take a long time, so the application would be paused.
Asynchronous calls not block the execution of the application and when the call returns de response from the server, a callback functions is executed.
Multi-threading in web appliaction can be used in parallel action as well, to handle requests from multiple clients.
