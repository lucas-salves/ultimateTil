# Use case Modeling

> A use case model shows a view of the system from the user perspective, thus describing what a system does without describing how the system does it. UML can be used to analyze the use case model, and to derive system objects and their interactions with each other and with the users of the system. Using UML techniques, you further analyze the objects and their interactions to derive object behavior, attributes, and relationships.

A use case provides developers with a view of what the users want. It is free of technical or implementation details. We can think of a use case as a sequence of transactions in a system. The use case model is based on the interactions and relationships of individual use cases.

A use case always describes three things: an actor that initiates an event; the event that triggers a use case; and the use case that performs the actions triggered by the event. In a use case, an actor using the system initiates an event that begins a related series of interactions in the system. Use cases are used to document a single transaction or event. An event is an input to the system that happens ata  specific time and place and causes the system to do something. For more information about use case symbols and how to draw use case diagrams, see Chapter 2.
