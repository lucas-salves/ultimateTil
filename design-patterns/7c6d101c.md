# Façade

Façade is a structural design pattern that hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client.
See below some goals of façade pattern:

* Abstract/simplify a sub-system complexity: Let's think about a "piece of code" that have a lot of logical and code of hard understanding. Sometimes, when we call a piece of code, we don't have to know your intern structure. We just want to use it. That is, is easily to access the piece of code by your façade.

* Uncouple a system favors the separation of concerns. A well designed system have to be a uncoupled system, with its parts independent of each other.

* Use façade design, reduces the dependency, giving conditions of maintainability/distributing/testing the isolated system part that has received the adjust.

* "Hide" dirty code when his refactoring is impracticable. That is, refactoring is always a good practice, but, there are some cases that is impracticable, like in legacy systems. In that cases, can be a good choice apply the Façade design to make it less worse.
