# Deleted by us conflict

The message *deleted by us:* occurs when you are working on a file and someone delete it and merge it to the branch you're working. To solve it, use git add to add the file to the stagin area again:

```
git add deleted-file-that-must-been-kept.txt
```

Than solve all other merge conflicts and do:
```
git rebase --continue
```

If you want to accept the deletion, do: 
```
git rm
```
