# Store git credentials in cache

How to store the git credentials in cache to avoid enter the password everytime

Do this to save on the memory. Remember that this never touch the disk, and are forgotten after a configurable timeout
```
git config credential-helper cache
```

Doing this one, will store your password unencrypted on the dik, protected only bu filesystem permissions. if this is not an acceptable security tradeoff, try git-credential-cache instead.
```
git config credential-helper store
```
