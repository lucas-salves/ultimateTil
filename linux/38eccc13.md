# Run more than one command at once

If you want to run each command if the previous one succeeded, use *&&* operator:

```
mkdir test_folder && cd test_folder
```

To run all commands, regardless of whether the previous ones failed or not,  separate with semicolons:

```
mkdir test_folder ; cd test_folder
```
