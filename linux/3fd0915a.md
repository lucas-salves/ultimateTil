# Select all text from terminal and copy/paste it

Select all and cut:
- Cursor at the beggining of a file
- *Ctrl* *6* to set a makr
- *Alt* *Shift* *T* (or try *alt* *t*) to cut to the end of the file
- If *alt* *t* doesn't work, try *ctrl* *k*

TO just copy the file content do:
- *ctrl* *u* to uncut the text again

Remembering that this works only inside *nano*. After you exit it, you can not uncut it in another app.
